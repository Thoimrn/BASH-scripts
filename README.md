## BASH-scripts
##### By: Thomas Hirneisen

### This project is an example of some simple network and system administration scripts I have written.

#### These scripts are in a BASH format. 


##### [SCRIPT_1](https://github.com/Thoimrn/BASH-scripts/blob/94b4cedf6846a9fefe555f99445fcfebdfb226eb/MvFile30) This script is a basic file cleanup that moves files modified more than 30 days ago. It prompts user to confirm action before running.

##### [SCRIPT_2](https://github.com/Thoimrn/BASH-scripts/blob/34e7f01b2f19f90dc8029bb7eabd6c1da1cc77c1/BannerGrabServer) This scripts pulls the server version from the response header of a select web url and saves it as a file in the specified directory.
