## BASH-scripts
##### By: Thomas Hirneisen

### This project is an example of some simple network and system administration scripts I have written.

#### These scripts are in a raw BASH format. 


##### [SCRIPT_1](https://github.com/Thoimrn/BASH-scripts/blob/9d3290a252931e9ad4f00589f8db57b757527c7b/MvFiles30) This script is a basic file cleanup that moves files older than 30 days. It also prompts user to confirm action before running.
