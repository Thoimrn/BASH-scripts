## BASH-scripts
##### By: Thomas Hirneisen

### This project is an example of some simple network and system administration scripts I have written.

#### These scripts are in a BASH format. 


##### [SCRIPT_1](https://github.com/Thoimrn/BASH-scripts/blob/94b4cedf6846a9fefe555f99445fcfebdfb226eb/MvFile30) ~ A basic file cleanup script that moves files modified more than 30 days ago. It prompts user to confirm action before running.

##### [SCRIPT_2](https://github.com/Thoimrn/BASH-scripts/blob/91eecde5aa5106c217d0321924f77fb39467fdab/BannerGrabServer) ~ This pulls the server version from the response header of a select web url and saves it as a file in the specified directory.

##### [SCRIPT_3](https://github.com/Thoimrn/BASH-scripts/blob/29d98323b2ae2f15d51c53edc16a82573b8e5d18/BitcoinPrice) ~ Using the free coindesk API, this script displays the current price of a bitcoin in USD, British Pounds, and Euros. 

##### [SCRIPT_4](https://github.com/Thoimrn/BASH-scripts/blob/29d98323b2ae2f15d51c53edc16a82573b8e5d18/BitcoinPrice) ~ This is a backup script using tape archive to backup and gzip to compress the files.
